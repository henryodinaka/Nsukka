            <p>&quot;We serve only <span class="twoTreesName"><em>Two Trees Extra Virgin Olive Oil</em> </span>at Iodice's Trattoria. There simply is no other olive oil that meets our standards.&quot; - <span class="testimonialName">Samantha Iodice, restaurant owner</span></p>
            <p><em>&quot;<span class="twoTreesName">Two Trees Olive Oil</span></em> is the only olive oil I would even consider cooking with or serving. It's the most authentic oil I've tasted since living in Italy.&quot; -<span class="testimonialName"> Giselle Varialle, Master Chef</span></p>
            <p>&quot;The flavored oils have a remarkably authentic, smooth, and mild flavor - nothing like the other flavored oils you'll see in your local market. They are superb on pasta, bread, and vegetables.&quot; - <span class="testimonialName">Thomas Garner, Hobby Chef</span></p>
            <p>&quot;I give two thumbs up to <em class="twoTreesName">Two Trees Olive Oil</em>! It's the best.&quot; - <span class="testimonialName">Laura Taylor, <em>Good Eats, Good Drinks Magazine</em>.</span></p>
